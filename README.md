# 📊 Machine Learning Projects – Salary and Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This repository contains two beginner-friendly machine learning projects focused on regression-based prediction using real-world datasets.

---

## 📁 Files

### 1. 🏥 `medical-insurance.ipynb`
Predicts individual **medical insurance charges** based on features like:
- Age
- Gender
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region

**Key Steps:**
- Data exploration and visualization
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Evaluation using R² score, MAE, MSE

---

### 2. 💼 `salary-predictor.ipynb`
Predicts **salary** based on years of experience using simple linear regression.

**Key Steps:**
- Data visualization (scatter plots)
- Feature reshaping
- Model training
- Prediction and evaluation
- Regression line visualization

---

## 🛠 Requirements

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
